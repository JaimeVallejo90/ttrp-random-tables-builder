# Random Table Generator

Build dice pools, apply keep/drop rules, and design custom outcomes with exact odds. The app shows:
- A live probability curve and per-total histogram.
- Outcome bands with their probability (and handy ~1/x approximations).
- A results table you can copy straight into your prep notes.

How to use
- Tap a die to add it; tap a pill in the pool to remove it. Choose keep/drop rules and counts.
- Define outcomes by setting their min/max totals; lock any ranges you don’t want auto-spread to change.
- Copy the outcome table for fast paste into docs.

Notes
- Supports sensible dice ranges and keep/drop up to reasonable sizes.
- Themes (dark/light) are available via the toggle in the header.
